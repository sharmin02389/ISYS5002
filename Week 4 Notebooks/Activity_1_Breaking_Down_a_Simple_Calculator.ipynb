        "> **Advanced Concept:**  The above process is known as refactoring. It is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing its internal organisation—without changing its external behaviour. Refactoring improves non-functional attributes of software, including code readability and reduced complexity. This can improve maintainability and make it easier to extend your programme in the future. Although this terminology may seem advanced now, it will become useful as you progress and work with more complex code and AI responses.\n",

        "     - Updating the menu and the decision structure in `perform_calculation()`.\n",
