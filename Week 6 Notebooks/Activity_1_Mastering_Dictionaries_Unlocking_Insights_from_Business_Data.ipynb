        "- **Analyse** the suitability of dictionaries for representing and manipulating business data in various scenarios.\n",
        "- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of different dictionary operations and methods for extracting insights from complex data structures.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries are powerful data structures that allow you to store and manipulate data in a flexible, efficient, and meaningful way. In the context of business data analysis, dictionaries can be invaluable for organizing, processing, and deriving insights from complex datasets. By mastering the use of dictionaries, you'll develop essential skills for tackling real-world business problems and making data-driven decisions.\n",

        "\n",
        "AI tools can be incredibly helpful for tasks like brainstorming, generating explanations, and verifying your work. However, it's crucial to use them responsibly and critically. When using AI in this worksheet:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Be transparent:** Clearly indicate when you're using AI to assist with a task, and reflect on how it influenced your process and learning.\n",
        "- **Critically evaluate:** Don't blindly accept AI-generated outputs. Carefully examine the relevance, accuracy, and completeness of the information it provides.\n",
        "- **Use AI as a learning partner:** Leverage AI to deepen your understanding, but don't rely on it to do the thinking for you. Use prompts that encourage critical analysis and justification of your choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you could ask an AI tool: \"What are the potential limitations of using dictionaries to represent and analyse complex business data structures? How would I need to critically evaluate the AI's response before applying it?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionaries:** A data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
        "- **Dictionary Operations:** Common operations like adding, modifying, and accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "- **Dictionary Methods:** Useful built-in methods for working with dictionaries, such as `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()`.\n",
        "- **Data Representation:** Choosing appropriate data structures (like dictionaries) to effectively model and represent business data.\n",
        "- **Data Analysis:** Techniques for extracting insights, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions from business data stored in dictionaries.\n",
